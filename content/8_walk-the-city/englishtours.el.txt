**FAMILY FRIENDLY TOURS**
Walk the city of Athens with "Voltes" a non-profit company specialized in family-friendly tours.

Born as an idea in 2015 and created by parents with years of experience as teachers, archaeologists and educators for preschool and school children, with the goal to answer the eternal big question: "Mom, dad what's this?"!

Our motto is: #LearnLoveLiveHistory and discover the past and present of Athens through unique, relaxed, kids oriented city walks to world-reknowned archaeological sites and museums.
